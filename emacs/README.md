Currently these files are for installing Emacs on RHEL-based systems, such as Fedora.

These playbooks use Fedora's [COPR](https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2014/03/11/intro-coprs) to access an [bhavin192's Emacs repo](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/bhavin192/emacs-pretest/) for installing Emacs. While building from source is great for security purposes and sometimes required by employers, using this repo is good enough for me for my personal project use.
